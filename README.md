nvim-setup
=========

My Neovim setup.  As of writing, nvim >= 0.5 is required.


Usage
-----

- Clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim`.

- Run the following command in the terminal:

``` sh
    nvim +PackerSync
```

**Note:** You may get errors when you run this command.  Don't worry about this though - just ignore them.  You only need to be concerned if you still get errors the next time you run nvim.

Now you're good to go!...
